## Managing an existing appointment

Occasionally (we hope) you'll need to cancel or reschedule an existing appointment. You can do this on the Calendar, Schedule or Clients pages - all three work in a similar way:

1. Find the relevant appointment, click on the three dots that appear when you hover over the appointment to open a menu
2. Click on *Cancel* or *Reschedule* to remove or change an appointment

Notifications will be sent confirming the change.

## FAQ's

### There's letters B, N, P, PR, C next to the appointments I've made with my clients. What do they mean?

Good question! We're going to make that clearer but in the meantime, here's the explanation:
* B: Blocked - you've made a custom event to block off time in your calendar
* N: New - brand new appointment has been made
* P: Paid - you've marked the appointment as paid
* PR: Payment Requested - a payment reminder has been sent to your client

### How much does AppointmentGuru cost?

We're still in beta, so we're still free!

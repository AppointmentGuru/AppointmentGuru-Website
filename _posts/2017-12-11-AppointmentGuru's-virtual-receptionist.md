# AppointmentGuru's Virtual Receptionist

Delegate all things AppointmentGuru to a [Virtual Receptionist](/landing-page/virtual-receptionist/) and focus on the important parts of your business.

## How it works

1. You'll get a unique phone number that your clients can call or SMS to book, cancel and reschedule appointments. There is a real person on the other end of the phone and calls will be answered with your business name.

2. The number can’t be used for WhatsApp, outgoing SMS’s or outgoing calls on your behalf (although that may change in the future).

3. Appointments are added and updated directly in your AppointmentGuru calendar - so you’re always in the loop.

4. Sending invoices and reminding clients to make outstanding payments (via automated reminders) can also be handled by your Virtual Receptionist.

5. The service is available 9am-5pm. If calls/SMS’s are received outside of that time, they may be answered. If not, there is an answering service with a personalised message.

6. The free trial is for a month, it kicks in when the service is activated (ie. your number is working).

7. Virtual Receptionist is available in English only (but let us know if you're interested in other languages).

8. To get the most out of the service, AppointmentGuru will review all automatic notifications and suggest improvements as time progresses. AppointmentGuru will also assist in publicising the new number (eg. SMS/email campaigns, etc).

9. Privacy is important to us, we'll make sure AppointmentGuru's Virtual Receptionists have signed an NDA's and/or patient confidentiality agreements (as compliance for POPI and the requirements of the HPCSA confidentiality). We also recommend that practitioners inform and get consent from their clients, notifying them that the Virtual Receptionist will have access to their information.

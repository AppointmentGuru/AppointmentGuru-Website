# AppointmentGuru's Virtual Receptionist

Delegate all things AppointmentGuru to a Virtual Receptionist and focus on the important parts of your business.

## How it works

1. You'll get a unique phone number that your clients can call or SMS to book, cancel and reschedule appointments. There is a real person on the other end of the phone and will be able to answer the call with your business name.
The number can’t be used for WhatsApp, outgoing SMS’s or outgoing calls on your behalf (although that might change in the future).
2. Appointments are added by us to your AppointmentGuru calendar - so you’re always in the loop.
3. Day-to-day admin is managed by your AppointmentGuru VR, so that your AppointmentGuru clients and appointments are always on point and up-to-date.
4. Monthly tasks - such as invoicing - can also be handled by your Virtual Receptionist.
Officially, the service is available 9am-5pm, but if calls/SMS’s are received outside of that time, they may be answered. If not, there is an answering service.
The free trial will be for a month, which kicks in when the service is activated (your number is working).
English only, until we get someone who can speak any other languages.
Voicemails are recorded with practitioners info
To get the most out of the service, AppointmentGuru will review all automatic notifications and suggest improvements as time progresses. AppointmentGuru will also assist in publicising the new number (eg. SMS/email campaigns, area's to update)
Ensure AppointmentGuru Calendar is up-to-date. Especially those days/times you’re not able to take appointments.

To get a good return, publicise the new number:

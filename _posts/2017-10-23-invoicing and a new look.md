# Invoicing is here! Along with a new look and lots of tweaks and fixes.

Our latest release is HUGE. It's a game-changer to us and we hope our customers will think so too. The biggest and newest feature is **invoicing** and **medical records**. Second to that is a **brand-new look and feel** for the web and practitioner apps. And of course, many **bug fixes** and little **updates** were made.

## Invoicing

This is the first version of our invoicing feature, so expect updates and improvements as we receive feedback! One of the most powerful aspects of AppointmentGuru invoicing is the ability to add medical aid-relevant codes (ICD-10, NAPPI etc). For more information on invoicing, please go to [how does invoicing work?](/help/how-does-invoicing-work/)

## Medical records

Along with medical codes, you'll be able to add your client's medical aid particulars. Scheme name and number, dependent information - the important details needed on invoices submitted to medical aids.

## New look and feel

* The web and mobile apps are virtually identical.
* Clicking on *Do It For Me* opens a chat tab where you can contact us super-easily.

## Bug fixes and updates

* You can now edit an existing appointment.
* You can also edit your client's information.
* Reporting is on it's own page, with more graphs.
* The graphs on the reporting page can be changed to show info over different time periods.
* More date pickers to narrow down your searches (eg. choose a date range on the Client page to see what clients you saw over that time period).
* We've removed the settings for your booking page (for now), it will come back soon.
* A shedload of backend updates, fixes and enhancements to make everything run zippier and look good.

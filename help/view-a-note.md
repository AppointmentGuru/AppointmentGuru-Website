# Where do I view the note I added to a particular appointment?

*Currently only available in the [mobile app](is-there-a-mobile-app).* Adding notes to an appointment can help to keep track of a client.

## Here's how to add and view notes:

1. Navigate to the appointment on your mobile app and tap the three dots on the bottom right.
2. In the menu that opens, tap on *Add a note* and add the note.
3. To view the note after saving it, follow the same steps.

We plan to build this feature out in the future.

# How do notifications work?

One of the beautiful parts of AppointmentGuru are the automated notifications. Allowing notifications to run automatically in the background allows you to focus on your business and other important parts of your life.

## There are six notifications that are setup by default:

1. **Payment reminder**: to remind your Client to pay their invoice, this can be sent by email or SMS.
<br /><br />
2. **Cancellation notification**: an automatic email or SMS confirming a cancellation.
<br /><br />
3. **Appointment reschedule notification**: if an existing appointment is changed, then a notification is sent by email or SMS.
<br /><br />
4. **Appointment reminder**: a reminder notification is sent the day before the scheduled appointment.
<br /><br />
5. **New appointment notification**: the notification sent to you when a new appointment is created by a Client.
<br /><br />
6. **Appointment confirmation message**: the email or SMS notification that is sent to the Client when they create an appointment.

By default, notifications are sent automatically unless you've specified that they mustn't be sent.

# How do I add an appointment?

Adding appointments is a key functionality of AppointmentGuru! Remember, there are a few things that need to be setup before you can start adding appointments like [adding your appointment types](/help/add-appointment-types) and [adding clients?](/help/add-clients).

## Add an appointment in the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/) or [mobile app](/help/is-there-a-mobile-app):

* Tap on the blue *plus* sign on the bottom right of the window
* Fill out the form and select the various options
* Click on *Create appointment*

Unless you've specified not to, a notification will be sent to the client with the details of their appointment.

# How do I add an appointment?

Adding appointments is the key functionality of AppointmentGuru! Remember, there are a few things that need to be setup before you can start adding appointments like [adding your appointment types](/help/add-appointment-types) and [adding clients?](/help/add-clients).

## Add an appointment in the [web app](https://portal.appointmentguru.co/):

* Hit the *A* key on your keyboard to open the new booking form.
* or, go to the Calendar page and select the appointment by highlighting the hours on the calendar with your cursor. A form will open and you can enter the appointment details.

You appointment will be created and added to the calendar view.

## Add an appointment in the [mobile app](/help/is-there-a-mobile-app):

* Tap on the blue *plus* sign and then the orange calendar icon to fill out the appointment form.
* or, go to *Clients*, choose the client and then *Create an appointment*.

Unless you've specified not to, a notification will be sent to the client with the details of their appointment.

# Can I change the background on my booking page?

Absolutely! You can either use one of the backgrounds we offer or add one of your own.

## To change the background using AppointmentGuru's options

1. Log into your AppointmentGuru account via the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/login).
2. Go to the [Settings page](http://app.appointmentguru.co/#/settings) and scroll down to *My website*
3. Click on *choose a template* to find a background image that you like.
4. Clicking on *publish now* will make the site live for people to visit.

If you'd prefer to use your own background image, feel free to [email it to us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co).

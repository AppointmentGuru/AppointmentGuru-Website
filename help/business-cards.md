# Business cards, just for you!

Once your AppointmentGuru free trial is over, and you've decided to stick with us, we'll send you some business cards that include your AppointmentGuru details. Those details are a link to your website as well as a QR code your customers can use to make an appointment with you via the AppointmentGuru app.

## Take a look at your business cards

1. Log into your AppointmentGuru account via the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/login).
2. Go to the Account page and click on *Home* and then *Edit* next to *Get business cards*.
3. If none are visible, feel free to mail us! Otherwise, you can expect your first 100 cards delivered to you soon.

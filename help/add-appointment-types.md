# Adding the different appointment types

Before adding clients or scheduling appointments, you'll need to define the type of appointments you offer. At the same time, you'll be adding your [location](/help/add-address) and [operating hours](/help/update-operating-hours).

## The steps:

1. Log into your AppointmentGuru account via the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/login)
2. Go to the [Settings page](http://app.appointmentguru.co/#/settings) and scroll down to *Services*
3. Click on *Add a New Product*
4. Add a name, price and time period for the type of appointment you offer
5. Remember to click on *Add Service* to save your changes
6. If you want to edit or remove a Product, click on the *X* alongside the Product listing (this is not working at the moment, please [contact us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) if you'd like us to make the change for you)

Repeat the above steps if you'd like to add more than one appointment type. For example, you might offer an *Introductory Consultation* and also a *Regular Consultation*.

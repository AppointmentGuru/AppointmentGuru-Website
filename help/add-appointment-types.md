# Adding the different appointment types

Before adding clients or scheduling appointments, you'll need to define the type of appointments you offer. At the same time, you'll be adding your [location](/help/add-address) and [operating hours](/help/update-operating-hours).

## The steps:

1. Log into your [AppointmentGuru account](https://app.appointmentguru.co/), click on *Account* and then *Locations*.
3. Click on the blue plus next to *Appointment types*.
4. Add a name, price and time period for the type of appointment you offer.
<!-- 5. If you want the appointment type not to be visible to your clients, select *Private*. -->
5. Adding a number next to *Order* will specify the order of the appointment types listed on your website and in the app.
6. Remember to Save!

To remove an appointment type, please [contact us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) and we will make the change for you.

Repeat the above steps if you'd like to add more than one appointment type. For example, you might offer an *Introductory Consultation* and also a *Regular Consultation*.

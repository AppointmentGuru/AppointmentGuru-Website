# Telling your clients about AppointmentGuru

AppointmentGuru allows your clients to book appointments with you and as a result saving you time. We recommend that you inform your clients about how to use AppointmentGuru to book and manage their own appointments. Here are our suggestions:

## What to tell them

Clients can book their appointments with you on your website or through the app. We can also provide a snippet of code to add to your existing website so that clients can book appointments there.

## Things to do

Clients find and contact you in different ways and it's important to keep enforcing the message!

* Send them an email or SMS - [we can help with that](/help/send-a-client-email).
* Let them know via WhatsApp.
* [Link the action button on your Facebook page](/help/linking-facebook) to your website.
* [Update your email signature](updating-your-signature) to include a link to your website.
* If you have a website, add the [booking code](booking-widget).

# I want to update my operating hours

Stipulating your operating hours means that your clients won't be able to book appointments with you when you're not available. Your AppointmentGuru account will have default operating hours defined when your account is created (8am-5pm) but you may want to change this - for example, you might not want to take appointments on a Monday morning and instead use the time to prepare for the week!

Your operating hours shouldn't change week-to-week. If there are time slots that you don't want booked by clients, you can [block off that time](/help/block-off-time) through the appointment creation process.

## Here's how to manage your operating hours

1. Log into your [AppointmentGuru account](https://app.appointmentguru.co/), click on *Account* and then *Locations*.
2. Click on *Edit* next to *Operating hours* and make your changes.
3. Should you want to add different hours for different days, click on *Add hours* on that particular day.
4. Remember to click on *Save*!

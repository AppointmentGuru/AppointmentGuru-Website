# Sending a QuickInvoice

If you're a business that doesn't need to add medical line items and you want to send invoices right after you've seen a client, the QuickInvoice is for you! Content on the invoice is generated from your Invoicing settings and the appointment information (appointment name and price).

## Here's how to send a QuickInvoice

1. Navigate to the appointment, on the Calendar or Appointments page and click on the three vertical dots.
2. Click on *send QuickInvoice*.
3. Give a name for the invoice (for example, *Customer name 12 Nov 2017*) and choose how to send the invoice.

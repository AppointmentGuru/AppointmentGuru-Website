# How do I give a client a discount for a specific appointment?

The appointment types that you would've added in your account settings have an associated cost for the client. However, if you'd like to give your client a discount so that the correct reporting appears on your dashboard and also appear on their invoice, you can do so!

When [editing an invoice](/help/edit-an-invoice), change the amount under *Appointment price*. This will reflect on the total amount due to your client.

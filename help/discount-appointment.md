# How do I give a client a discount for a specific appointment?

The appointment types that you would've added in your account settings have an associated cost for the client. However, if you'd like to give your client a discount so that the correct reporting appears on your dashboard and also appear on their invoice, you can do so!

## Here's how to give a discount

1. When accessing a particular appointment (in the web or mobile app), tap the three dots on the bottom right and then on *Invoice details*
2. Enter the actual amount you'd like to charge.

Soon, you'll be able to send invoices from AppointmentGuru directly and until then we can generate your invoices for you whenever you like - [just let us know](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co).

# Linking your Facebook page and AppointmentGuru

If you have a Facebook page that your clients visit, you can easily link Facebook and AppointmentGuru.

## Use *+ Add a Button* to direct customers to your website

Facebook has a call-to-action button that you can add to your page. The [button can be configured](https://www.facebook.com/help/977869848936797?helpref=search&sr=2&query=button) to include the link to your website.

## Add an instant reply when you receive a Facebook message

If a message is sent to you on Facebook and you're not available to reply right away, you can [add an instant reply](https://www.facebook.com/help/1615627532020480?helpref=search&sr=1&query=response%20assistant) that includes information on making a booking.

We'd be happy to help you get the two Facebook features setup, let us know via [email](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/appointmentguru).

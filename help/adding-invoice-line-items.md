# Adding invoice line items

Some invoices may require more detail in the form of line items. These can be added via the Appointment, Client or when you create the specific invoice - all work the same way.

## After navigating to the invoice editing screen you can:

* Edit the invoice title.
* Add line items by clicking on the blue plus - choose the type of medical aid code and its specific details.
* Once you're done, click on *Mark as ready for invoicing*.

If the *Medical aid line items* area is not showing, click on the refresh button next to the client name on the *Add invoice details* screen.

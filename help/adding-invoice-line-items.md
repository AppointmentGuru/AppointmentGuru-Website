# Adding invoice line items

Some invoices may require more detail in the form of line items, particularly codes for medical aid submission. These can be added via an appointment or the Invoicing page.

Once you've landed on editing the actual invoice, these are the steps to follow:

* Click on the blue-plus sign next to *Medical aid line items*.
* In the box that opens, add or search for the appropriate codes. As you use this feature, your often-used codes and prices will be remembered.
* To add multiple line items, click on *Add and add more*.
* Edit an existing line item by clicking on it and remove one by clicking on the trash can to the right.
* Once you're done, click on *Ready for invoicing*.

Invoices can be sent (and resent) from Invoicing page.

# Can I view a list of all the appointments that a client has had with me?

Log into your [AppointmentGuru account](https://app.appointmentguru.co) and find the client in your list of clients. You'll be able to view and do the following:

* See a list of appointments booked (and those canceled) with that specific client.
* Invoice or mark an appointment as paid or send a payment reminder.
* Reschedule or cancel any future appointments.

# I want to send an automatic payment reminder to clients who haven't paid

Cashflow in any business is important and chasing outstanding payments can be time-consuming. We've added the ability for you to send payment reminders to clients.

## Where to edit the notification

By default, the payment reminder says *Hi {{client.first_name}}. Just a friendly reminder: {{appointment.currency}}{{appointment.price}} is owed to {{me.get_full_name}}. Banking details: ...*

It's advised that you edit it to include any other information, usually you can do this yourself but it is currently disabled.

2. Click on the first notification *Payment reminder* and choose whether you want to edit the SMS or email notification.
3. Once edited, clicking on the blue Save button to save the message. -->

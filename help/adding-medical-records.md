# Adding medical records

Medical aid-specific information (scheme name, number, client details etc) need to be added to invoices that are submitted to a medical aid. When you add these details, you'll only need to add them once and they will always appear on invoices made for that particular client.

## Here's how to add medical information

1. Find the relevant client on the Client page, click on it.
2. Click on the *Medical Record* tab under *Client details* and then on the blue *Create Record* button.
3. Click on *Edit* to start adding data and *Save* when you're done.

It's that easy!

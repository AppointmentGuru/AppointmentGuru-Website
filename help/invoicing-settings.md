The correct Practice Name, Number and bank details can be added on the *Profile* page after clicking on *Account* in your AppointmentGuru account. Add your business-specific details and click on *Save*. They will appear on your invoices by default.

If you'd like to include your logo, you can upload it by clicking on *Account* > *Media*.

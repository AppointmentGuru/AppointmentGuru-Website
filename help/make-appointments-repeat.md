# Can I make appointments repeat for repeating customers?

If you have regular clients, there's an easy way to create repeating appointments so that you don't have to add them one-by-one.

## To create repeating appointments:

1. When you're setting up an appointment, click on *Make this appointment repeat*.
2. Choose the quantity of repeats and whether it's a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly repeat.
3. If one of the repeats shouldn't happen, you have the option to remove it by clicking on the trash can.

# Where do I add my clients?

Adding client information to your AppointmentGuru account allows you to schedule appointments with them. It also means they'll get automated notifications and you'll be able to view past information -  how many appointments they've had with you, whether they've paid etc.

Clients don't have to be pre-loaded into your account in order for them to make an appointment with you.

## Here's how to add clients in the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/)

* Go to the Clients tab and click on the plus (+) sign at the top right to open a new form to complete
* Or, just hit the C key on your keyboard to open the new client form.

## Here's how to add clients in the [mobile app](/help/is-there-a-mobile-app)

* Tap on the blue *plus* sign and then the red icon to fill out the client form. If your client is already added to your phone's address book, then you'll be able to add them even more easily!

# Where do I add my clients?

Adding client details to your AppointmentGuru account allows you to schedule appointments with them. It also means they'll get automated notifications and you'll be able to store and view detailed information (how many appointments they've had with you, invoices, whether they've paid, notes, medical records etc).

Clients don't have to be pre-loaded into your account in order for them to make an appointment with you. You also don't need to have their email address but you need to have their mobile number.

## Adding a client via the Client page

* Go to the Clients page, scroll to the end of your client list and click on *+ New Client* to open a new form to complete.

## Adding a client when creating an appointment

* Click on the blue *plus* sign and start to fill out the appointment form.
* Click on *Choose a client* and then the person icon to add a new client.

On either option, you can add a clients details from the Contacts app on your phone by clicking on *CONTACTS* when completing a new clients details.

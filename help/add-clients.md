# Where do I add my clients?

Adding client information to your AppointmentGuru account allows you to schedule appointments with them. It also means they'll get automated notifications and you'll be able to view past information -  how many appointments they've had with you, invoices, whether they've paid, notes etc.

Clients don't have to be pre-loaded into your account in order for them to make an appointment with you.

## Here's how to add clients in the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/)

* Go to the Clients page, scroll to the end of your client list and click on *+ New Client* to open a new form to complete.

## Here's how to add clients in the [mobile app](/help/is-there-a-mobile-app)

* Tap on the blue *plus* sign and then the red icon to fill out the client form. If your client is already added to your phone's address book, then you'll be able to add them even more easily!

# I need to add information to the appointment reminder notification sent to my clients

When an appointment confirmation or reminder is sent to your Clients, you can add extra information they may need to know. For example, telling them to wear comfortable clothes, or to knock because the buzzer is broken - anything to make your life easier!

## Here's how to edit the notification

1. Log into your [AppointmentGuru account](https://portal.appointmentguru.co/) and go to the Settings page.
2. Under *Communication messages*, click on the message you would like to edit and make changes in the fields provided
3. Save your changes by clicking on the blue save icon
4. Make sure you've got it right by sending a test message (click on the green arrow)

## We can do it for you!

Send the changes you'd like to make [to us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) and we'll update them for you.

2. [Upload your client information](add-clients) (name, email and mobile number)
3. [Start scheduling appointments!](add-an-appointment)

## What happens next?

1. The day before a scheduled appointment, your client will receive a [reminder notification](how-are-notifications-sent)
2. You will be able to [reschedule](reschedule-appointment) or [cancel](cancel-appointment) appointments
3. You'll be able to [add information to the notifications](edit-notifications) sent to your clients
4. [Marking appointments as paid](mark-as-paid) will enable you to quickly see where you need to chase clients for payment

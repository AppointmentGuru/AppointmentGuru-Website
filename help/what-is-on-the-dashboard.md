# What can I see on my dashboard?

Whenever you log into your [AppointmentGuru account](https://app.appointmentguru.co), you'll be able to see a dashboard that contains reporting on your AppointmentGuru clients, payments and activity.

## Here's a list of reports

1. Charts of appointments for the current month.
2. Projected revenue based on the appointments booked that month.
3. Revenue received based on the appointments you've marked as paid.
4. A chart showing expected and actual revenue received.
5. Your busiest days and hours.

If there are other things you'd like to see on the dashboard, [let us know](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co)!

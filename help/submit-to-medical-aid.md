# Submit your invoice to medical aids

We haven't yet implemented direct submission to medical aids but it's definitely on our to-do list. In the meantime, the option is to send the invoice to yourself by email and then forward it on to the medical aid claim address.

We look forward to introducing medical aid submission features in the future!

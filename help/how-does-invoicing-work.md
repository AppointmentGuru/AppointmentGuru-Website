# How does invoicing work?

AppointmentGuru's invoicing caters for South African medical practitioners whose invoices need to be submitted to medical aids. This means you can include various codes like ICD-10, process and NAPPI codes.

Invoicing can be done as your appointments happen or you can complete them at the end of the month. The process in a nutshell is:

1. Make sure your Practice details are correct on the Settings page (you only need to enter them once).

2. Add your clients medical information (medical aid details, address etc), this also only needs to be entered once.

3. As you finish an appointment with a client, update the appointment with any relevant codes, notes and information.

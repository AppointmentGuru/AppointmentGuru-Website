# How does invoicing work?

AppointmentGuru's invoicing works for anyone but it also caters for South African medical practitioners whose invoices need to be submitted to medical aids. This means you can include various codes like ICD-10, process, procedure and NAPPI.

Invoicing can be done as your appointments happen or you can complete them at the end of the month.

## Here's how it works

1\. Make sure your business details are correct on the [Settings page](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/settings) (you only need to enter them once). [Read more on this link](/help/invoicing-settings).

2\. If required, add your clients personal and medical information (medical aid details, address etc), this also only needs to be entered once. [Read more on this link](/help/adding-medical-records).

3\. As you finish an appointment with a client, update the appointment with any relevant codes, notes and information. [Read more about line items on this link](/help/adding-invoice-line-items). If you don't need to add line items and want to send the invoice right away, we have [QuickInvoice](/help/quickinvoice)!

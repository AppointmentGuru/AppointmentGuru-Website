# How does invoicing work?

AppointmentGuru's invoicing works for anyone and it also caters for South African medical practitioners whose invoices are submitted to medical aids. This means you can include various codes like ICD-10, process, procedure and NAPPI codes.

Invoicing can be done as your appointments happen or you can complete them at the end of the week or month - whatever suits you!

## Here's how it works

#### 1. Add the business information that needs to appear on invoices

If this information wasn't added when your AppointmentGuru account was created, you'll need to add it only once - before you start sending your invoices. Go to the [Settings page](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/settings) in the app:

#### 2. Make sure additional client details are added to their profile

If required, add your clients personal and medical information (address, medical aid details etc), this also only needs to be entered once per client. Find the client on the [Clients page](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/clients) and click on *Medical Record* > *Create Record* to add their details.

#### 3. Sending an invoice for a specific appointment?

As you finish an appointment with a client, update the appointment with any relevant codes, notes and information and send!

* To include medical aid line items, click on the appointment and easily add codes by clicking on the blue-plus sign next to *Medical aid line items*.
* If you don't need to include any line items, select *Send QuickInvoice*. Or, go to the [Invoices page](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/invoices), find the client in the *Invoiceable* column and click on the arrow to start the invoicing process (see more below).

Invoices can be sent by SMS and/or email to your client, and by email to yourself.

#### 4. Sending an invoice for a bunch of appointments?

If you send invoices on a monthly basis, for example, you can send an invoice that includes each specific appointment and its related details.

* Go to the [Invoices page](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/invoices), find the client in the *Invoiceable* column (sometimes, using the date filter on the top-right is helpful if you have lots of clients) and click on the arrow to start the invoicing process.
* Select the correct invoicing dates and choose which appointments should be included in the invoice.
* To edit/add more details on the invoice, click on the 3 dots to the left of the client name in the *In progress* column and *Edit*.
* Once finished, save the invoice and click on the arrow to send the invoice to your client and yourself.

#### 5. Reminding and marking as paid

* If you want to send a reminder to your client to pay their invoice, click on the three dots to the right of their name in the *Sent* column and select *Send again*.
* If your client has paid the invoice, click on the check mark in the *Sent* column and it will move to the *Paid* column. You can also *Mark as paid* while it's in the *Invoiceable* column or even on the appointment on the Calendar page.

## Invoicing features still to come

* Download all invoices (not yet available but [contact us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) and we'll get it done for you).
* Submitting to medical aids directly.
* Digitising the New Client form - your new clients will be able to complete it online and it will sync back to your AppointmentGuru account to make invoicing even easier.

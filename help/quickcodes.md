# How do QuickCodes work?

Adding ICD-10 and process codes can be an arduous task. We’ve added QuickCodes to help make this easier for you.

To make your invoicing process simpler and more frictionless, we recommend keeping your appointments up to date as you go. Here’s a quick video, showing how it works:

You can easily add ICD10 and process codes by accessing QuickCodes after clicking on the three vertical dots from an appointment in the mobile or web app. It also includes:
* Searching for ICD10 codes
* Searching for process codes (including the recommended Discovery Scheme price)
* Quickly select codes that you’ve used before

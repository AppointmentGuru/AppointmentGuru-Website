# Can I turn the notifications off and on?

By default, notifications are set to go out or are 'on'. If you have a client or a particular action you'd like to stop notifications for, here's how:

* When creating an appointment, toggle the checkbox next to *Send Notifications* to send a notification or not.
* When rescheduling or canceling an appointment, a prompt will open, also with a checkbox next to *Send a message to the customer*.

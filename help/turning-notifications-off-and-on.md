# Can I turn the notifications off and on?

By default, notifications are set to go out or are 'on'. If you have a client or a particular action you'd like to stop notifications for, here's how:

* When creating an appointment, make sure it says *No* next to *Send Notifications* under the *Advanced* section.
* When rescheduling or canceling an appointment, prompts will open, asking if you want to send a notification or not.

# I want to block off time so that clients can't make bookings

There will be blocks of time where you won't want your Clients to be able to book appointments. There are two ways to get this done:

## Once-off blocking

1. Go to the Schedule page in the [web app](https://portal.appointmentguru.co/) and mark a timeslot as unavailable by clicking on the *X*.
2. On the Calendar page select the timeslot, click on *Custom Event* that appears in the block opening on the right and complete the form.

## Permanent blocking

1. Log into your [AppointmentGuru account](https://portal.appointmentguru.co/) and go to the Settings page.
2. Under *Configure Services*, click on your current service and go to *Operating Hours*.
3. Select the days and hours you'd like to be available for appointments, remember to click on *Update Operating Hours*.
4. Should you want to add different hours for different days, click on *Add More Hours* or *Add More Days*.

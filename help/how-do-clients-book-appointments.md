# How do my clients book appointments with me?

When you sign-up to AppointmentGuru, you'll get a free website and your clients will be able to use a mobile app to make bookings with you.

For either option, your clients will only need to choose a date and time that you're available and complete the booking by adding their phone number and email address.

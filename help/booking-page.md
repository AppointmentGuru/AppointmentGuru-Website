# What is the booking page?

With your AppointmentGuru account, you'll get a free booking page that your clients can use to book appointments with you. Right now, it'll contain a bunch of info as well as a booking widget where clients can make their appointments.

## Accessing the settings of your booking page

1. Log into your AppointmentGuru account via the [web app](https://portal.appointmentguru.co/#/login).
2. Go to the [Settings page](http://portal.appointmentguru.co/#/settings) and scroll down to *My website*
3. Click on *choose a template* to find a background image that you like. If you'd prefer to use your own background image, feel free to [email it to us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co).
4. Clicking on *publish now* will make the site live for people to visit.

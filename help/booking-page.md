# What is the free website?

With your AppointmentGuru account, you'll get a free website (and [mobile app for your clients](/help/is-there-a-mobile-app)!) where your clients can book appointments with you. It displays info on your services as well as a booking widget where clients can make their appointments.

## Accessing the settings of your website

1. Log into your AppointmentGuru account via the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/login).
2. Go to the Account page and click on *Get online*.
3. You'll be able to find the address of your website under *Your website*.
4. To find a background image that you like, use search terms and make your choice.

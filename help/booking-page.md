# What is the free website?

With your AppointmentGuru account, you'll get a free website that your clients can use to book appointments with you. It displays info on your services as well as a booking widget where clients can make their appointments.

Viewing the settings for your website is currently disabled. If you'd like to find out what your address is or make a change, please contact us via [email](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) or click on *Do it for me* in the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/).

<!-- ## Accessing the settings of your booking page

1. Log into your AppointmentGuru account via the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/login).
2. Go to the [Settings page](http://app.appointmentguru.co/#/settings) and scroll down to *My website*
3. Click on *choose a template* to find a background image that you like. If you'd prefer to use your own background image, feel free to [email it to us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co).
4. Clicking on *publish now* will make the site live for people to visit. -->

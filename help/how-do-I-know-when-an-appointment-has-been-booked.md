# How do I know when a client has booked an appointment with me?

Whether a client has made a booking with you on your [booking page](/help/booking-page) or via the [mobile app](/help/is-there-a-mobile-app), you will be sent a notification that the appointment has been made.

Like all notifications, you can edit them to have specific information you require, more info [on this link](/help/edit-notifications/).

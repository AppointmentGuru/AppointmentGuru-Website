# Editing appointments not working

While you can cancel or reschedule an appointment, you won't be able to edit any other details on a particular appointment. This is something we're working to change.

As a workaround, we suggest that you either cancel the appointment and start again, or [contact us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) for help!

# I need to reschedule an appointment

Occasionally (we hope) you'll need to cancel or reschedule an existing appointment:

1. Find and click on the relevant appointment.
2. A menu will open, click on *Cancel* or *Reschedule* to remove or change an appointment.
3. Notifications will be sent confirming the change.

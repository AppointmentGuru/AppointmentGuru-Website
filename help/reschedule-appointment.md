# I need to reschedule an appointment for a client

Occasionally (we hope) you'll need to cancel or reschedule an existing appointment:

1. Find and click on the relevant appointment.
2. A menu will open, click on *Cancel* or *Reschedule* to remove or change an appointment.
3. Notifications will be sent confirming the change.

# I am a client and I'd like to reschedule an appointment

1. You'll need to have the [AppointmentGuru app](http://getapp.guru/) on your phone, login once it's downloaded.
2. Tap on *Appointments* and find the related appointment.
3. Tap on the appointment and then on *Reschedule* to choose a new date/time.
4. If *Reschedule* is greyed out, it means it's within 24 hours of the appointment and you'll need to contact the Practitioner directly to make the change - a cancellation fee may apply.

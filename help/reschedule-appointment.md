# I need to reschedule an appointment

Occasionally (we hope) you'll need to cancel or reschedule an existing appointment. You can do this on the Calendar, Schedule or Clients pages in the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co) or [mobile app](/help/is-there-a-mobile-app) - all work in a similar way:

1. Find the relevant appointment, click on the three dots that appear when you hover over the appointment
2. A menu will open, click on *Cancel* or *Reschedule* to remove or change an appointment
3. Notifications will be sent confirming the change.

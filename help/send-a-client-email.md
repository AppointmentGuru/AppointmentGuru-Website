## In order to send the email, we would need the following information:

* The from-email address (keep in mind that it will also receive replies).
* A list of clients with their email address and first-name.
* When the email should be sent.

Once the email has been loaded, we will send you test emails to confirm that it's right before it's ready to go. We will also be able to send you a report with details of those who opened the email, bounced mails etc.

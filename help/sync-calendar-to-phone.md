# Can the calendar sync to my phone's calendar?

You can definitely sync your calendar apps!

## Finding the Calendar feed URL in your AppointmentGuru account

1. Login to the AppointmentGuru [web app](https://portal.appointmentguru.co).
2. Click on calendar, then scroll to the bottom of the page. You should see a link which looks like this:

![Calendar-subscribe-link](/help/images/calendar/calendar-subscribe-link.png)

Once you have the link, you can add it to your calendar of choice. Two things to remember:

1. It's a read-only calendar, so you won't be able to add appointments and expect it to sync back to AppointmentGuru.
2. Some calendars take a while to sync (especially if your calendar is on a Google account).

## Add the Calendar to your iPhone calendar app

1. On your iPhone, go to Settings > Calendar > Accounts > Add account > Other > Add subscribed account.
2. Paste the Calendar URL.

## Add the Calendar to your Android calendar app

1. Follow the steps to add the Calendar to your Google Calendar ([on this link](/help/sync-calendar-to-app)).
2. On your Android device, go to the Calendar App, or S Planner and choose the additional calendars to display.

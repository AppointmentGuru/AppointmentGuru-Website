# Can the calendar sync to my Outlook or Calendar app?

You can definitely sync your calendar apps!

## Finding the Calendar feed URL in your AppointmentGuru account

1. Login to the AppointmentGuru [web app](https://portal.appointmentguru.co).
2. Click on calendar, then scroll to the bottom of the page. You should see a link which looks like this:

![Calendar-subscribe-link](/help/images/calendar/calendar-subscribe-link.png)

Once you have the link, you can add it to your calendar of choice. Two things to remember:

1. It's a read-only calendar, so you won't be able to add appointments and expect it to sync back to AppointmentGuru.
2. Some calendars take a while to sync (especially if your calendar is on a Google account).

## Add the Calendar to your Google Calendar

1. In Google Calendar, go to Other Calendars > dropdown arrow > Add by URL
2. Paste the Calendar URL
3. Add the Calendar to your Outlook Calendar

## On Outlook.com go to Calendar > Import > Subscribe

1. Paste the Calendar URL
2. Add the Calendar to your Mac Calendar

## Add the Calendar to your Mac Calendar

1. In the Calendar App, go to File > New Calendar Subscription
2. Paste the Calendar URL

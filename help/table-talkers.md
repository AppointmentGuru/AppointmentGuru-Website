# Table talkers

Once your AppointmentGuru free trial is over, and you've decided to stick with us, we'll send you some table talkers (and business cards) to display at your place of business. This will allow your clients to scan the QR code on the table talker and immediately book another appointment with you. The QR code will either open your booking page or the AppointmentGuru app.

If you haven't received a table talker from us, [send us an email](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) and we'll get on it right away.

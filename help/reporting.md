# How does reporting work?

Reporting can give you useful insight into your business. Most of the reporting is automated - meaning that you only need to use AppointmentGuru to generate the info. However, some of the reporting is reliant on you ensuring your AppointmentGuru account is up-to-date by:

* Making sure to mark appointments as canceled if they are canceled to show the correct number of appointments and projected revenue.
* Marking appointments/invoices as paid to view the difference between outstanding and received income.

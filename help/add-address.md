# Where do I add my physical address?

An important part of allowing your clients to schedule appointments with you is making sure they know where you are! You'll be able to add your location(s) when adding your [appointment types](/help/add-appointment-types) and [operating hours](/help/update-operating-hours). Clients will also be able to specify the location when they make a booking with you, if you'd like to enable that feature, [please contact us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co).

## Here are the steps

1. Log into your [AppointmentGuru account](https://app.appointmentguru.co/), click on *Account* and then *Locations*.
2. Click on *Add location* to add a new one or *Edit* to change an existing location.
3. Add your address and contact details, remember to click on *Save*.
4. If you'd like to have specific instructions on the appointments created for that location, add them to *Instructions for once they get there*. This will be added to the appointment info visible in the app for your clients (it won't be added to any SMS or email notifications though, that's done under *Notifications*).

Should you want to add another location, repeat the steps. For example, you may have a practice at home but also offer your services from another practitioner's location once a week.

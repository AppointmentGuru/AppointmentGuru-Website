# Where do I add my physical address?

An important part of allowing your clients to schedule appointments with you is making sure they know where you are! You'll be able to add your location(s) when adding your [appointment types](add-appointment-types) and [operating hours](update-operating-hours).

## Here are the steps:

1. Log into your AppointmentGuru account via the [web app](https://portal.appointmentguru.co/#/login)
2. Go to the [Settings page](http://portal.appointmentguru.co/#/settings) and scroll down to *Services*
3. Under *Location*, click on *Add a new service* and *Click here* to edit
4. Add your address and contact details, remember to click on *Save Changes*

Should you want to add another location, repeat the steps. For example, you may have a practice at home but also offer your services from another practitioner's location once a week.

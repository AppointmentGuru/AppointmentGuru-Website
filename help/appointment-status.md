# What do the letters B, N, and P in the appointment mean?

Good question! We're going to make that clearer but in the meantime, here's the explanation:

* B: Blocked - you've made a custom event to block off time in your calendar
* N: New - brand new appointment has been made
* P: Paid - you've marked the appointment as paid
* PR: Payment Requested - a payment reminder has been sent to your client

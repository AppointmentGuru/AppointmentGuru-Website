# How do I reset my password?

If you can't remember your password, we would have to reset your password for you. Send us an [email](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) with your request and we'll get back to you right away.

If you do know your password but you want to change it, log into your [AppointmentGuru account](https://app.appointmentguru.co/), click on *Account* and then *Profile* to add a different password.

# A client has paid, how do I mark it as paid?

Keeping tabs on whether a client has paid or not is useful both in keeping track of cashflow and making sure your reporting is up-to-date.

If the invoice is in the *In progress* column, click on the three dots and *Mark as paid*. If it's in the *Sent* column, click on the checkmark to confirm payment. It will then move to the *Paid* column.

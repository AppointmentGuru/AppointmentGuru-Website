# A client has paid, how do I mark it as paid on the appointment?

Keeping tabs on whether a client has paid or not is useful both in keeping track of cashflow and making sure your dashboard is up-to-date. Appointments can be marked as paid on the Calendar, Schedule or Client pages in the [web app](https://app.appointmentguru.co) or [mobile app](/help/is-there-a-mobile-app) - all work in a similar way:

1. Find the relevant appointment, click on the three dots that appear when you hover over the appointment.
2. A menu will open, click on *Mark as paid* to change the status of the appointment to *payment received*.

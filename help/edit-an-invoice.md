# Editing and sending an invoice

This help page outlines how to send an invoice from the Invoicing page/tab of the web or mobile app. You can also use [QuickInvoice](/help/quickinvoice) to send invoices on a per-appointment basis.

As your appointments complete, they are added to the *Invoiceable* column on the [invoicing page](https://app.appointmentguru.co/#/invoices). The column is organised by client and you'll be able to create an invoice based on the appointments they've had with you but not yet paid for. You also be able to exclude any appointments from the invoice you're creating.

## Step 1

* In the *Invoiceable* column, select the client for whom you'd like to make an invoice.
* In *1. Invoice details* edit the invoice name if needed and you have the option to complete their medical records (add medical aid information so that the invoice can be submitted to their scheme). Click on the blue *Next* button.
* In *2. Choose appointments*, check whether you'd like to include or exclude certain appointments by either clicking on the *plus* or *minus* icons to the left of the appointment listing and click on *Next*
* *3. Confirm and create* allows you to create the invoice by clicking on *Save invoice*.

If you'd like to [add specific line items](/help/adding-invoice-line-items) to an appointment, click on the *edit* icon to the right of an appointment.
* Click on *Save invoice*.

## Step 2

* The invoice has moved to the *In progress* column. At this point you can send it, or you can edit the invoice by clicking on the three vertical dots on the left. If your client has already paid, clicking on the three dots will also allow you to mark it as paid.
* Edit it to include more details such as a different invoice number, due date and amount already paid (should that be the case).
* An invoice preview will appear in the right pane when you're editing the invoice so that you can see what it will look like.

## Step 3

* Time to send the invoice! Click on the *send* icon to the right of the invoice in the *In progress* column (it looks like an arrowhead).
* You'll be able to send it to yourself and/or your client by SMS and/or email.
* The invoice will move into the *Sent* column.

## Step 4

* Now the invoice will be in the *Sent* column - here you can click on the three vertical dots to view or send the invoice again.
* Once you've received payment, click on the *check* icon to mark as paid and the invoice will move to the final column.

# Setting up your account

To get the best out of AppointmentGuru, you'll need to add and edit your settings. You can do this yourself by clicking on *Account* (on the left in your account) or ask us to help! The quickest way to get that done is to click on *Do it for me* in the app or [contact us](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co).

Here's a brief overview of the account settings:

1. **Profile**: add your business or practice name and number as well as banking details. The bank details will appear on the invoices you send to your clients.

2. **Locations**: add your business address(es), operating hours and appointment types. An important part of configuring your account as it will allow you to begin creating appointments and send the correct info on the notifications to your clients.

3. **Media**: be visible with a profile pic and your logo! The profile pic will appear in the apps and your logo will be added to your invoices.

4. **Notifications**: the automated notifications sent to you and your clients are already setup when your account is created. Here you can edit them with any extra info you'd like to add.

5. **Get online**: publish or remove your free website and listing in the AppointmentGuru app.

6. **For your phone**: get the link to download the AppointmentGuru app and also sync your AppointmentGuru calendar to the calendar app on your phone or computer.

7. **Billing**: get information and receipts on your AppointmentGuru subscription.

If you're in Joburg or Cape Town, we can meet with you to get you started. Go to the [Get a Guru page](/get-a-guru) for more information.

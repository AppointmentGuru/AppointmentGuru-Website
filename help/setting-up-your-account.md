# Setting up your account

If you need help setting up your AppointmentGuru account, we'd be happy to do it for you. The quickest way to get that done is to use our forms, click on the links below to access them.

* [Add your business, operating hours and appointment types](/help/files/import-services.docx)
* [Add your clients](/help/files/import-clients.docx)
* [Add existing and past appointments](/help/files/import-appointments.docx)

**Please note:**

* If you already have a file of your clients, feel free to send that through to us instead of filling out the form.
* If you've been using a physical diary for appointments, take photo's of the appointments with your phone and send those to us instead of filling out the form.

If you're in Joburg or Cape Town, we can meet with you to get you started. Go to the [Get a Guru page](/get-a-guru) for more information.

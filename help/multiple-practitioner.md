# My business has more than one practitioner, can I use AppointmentGuru?

AppointmentGuru currently offers an account that is **perfect** for a business with a single practitioner. We plan to build out functionality that would seamlessly include multiple practitioners in a practice in the future.

However, until that functionality is available, there are ways that a multiple-practitioner business can use AppointmentGuru.

1. Setup two different AppointmentGuru accounts and we'll provide you with a booking page for your practice.

2. Use one AppointmentGuru account and create appointment types specifically for each practitioner.

Here's a table comparing the two:

|Two AppointmentGuru accounts|One AppointmentGuru account|
|-|-|
|Your own practice information \*|Shared practice information \*|
|Two accounts with your own login details|Shared login details using one email address and one mobile number|
|Separate invoicing|Shared invoicing|
|Separate clients|Shared clients|
|Separate calendars|Shared calendar|
|Your own customised notifications|Shared notifications that can specify practitioners|
|Your own operating hours and appointment types|Your own operating hours and appointment types|
|One month free trial|One month free trial|
|A 50% discount until proper functionality is built|R400 per month|
|AppointmentGuru monthly subscription deducted from two cards|Monthly subscription deducted from one card|
|Two booking pages and a practice page|One booking page|

\* Practice information is address, phone number, email address, practice description, logo and profile pic

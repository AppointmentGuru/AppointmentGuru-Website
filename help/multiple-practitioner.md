# My business has more than one practitioner, can I use AppointmentGuru?

AppointmentGuru currently offers an account that is **perfect** for a business with a single practitioner. We are adding functionality that seamlessly includes multiple practitioners in a practice(s).

In the meantime, we have two options available:

* Your own practice information \*
* Separate accounts, each with their own login details
* Separate invoicing
* Separate clients
* Separate calendars
* Your own customised notifications
* Your own operating hours and appointment types
* One month free trial
* A discount until the functionality is no longer in beta
* AppointmentGuru monthly subscription deducted from two cards
* Two separate websites (a demo site: [bookme.guru/eatwell](https://bookme.guru/eatwell/)) as well as a group practice page (a demo group page: [appointmentguru.co/demo-group-page](https://appointmentguru.co/demo-group-page/))

Another alternative is to use one AppointmentGuru account but create appointment types specifically for each practitioner. Here's how that would work:

* Shared practice information \*
* Shared login details using one email address and one mobile number
* Shared invoicing
* Shared clients
* Shared calendar
* Shared notifications that can specify practitioners
* Your own operating hours and appointment types
* One month free trial
* R400 per month
* Monthly subscription deducted from one card
* One website

\* Practice information is address, phone number, email address, practice description, logo and profile pic

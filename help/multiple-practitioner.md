# My business has more than one practitioner, can I use AppointmentGuru?

AppointmentGuru currently offers an account that is **perfect** for a business with a single practitioner. We plan to build out functionality that would seamlessly include multiple practitioners in a practice in the future.

However, until that functionality is available, there are ways that a multiple-practitioner business can use AppointmentGuru.

1. Setup two different AppointmentGuru accounts and we'll provide you with a booking page for your practice.
2. Use one AppointmentGuru account and create appointment types specifically for each practitioner.

Here's the differences between the two:

**Two AppointmentGuru accounts**
* Your own practice information \*
* Two accounts with your own login details
* Separate invoicing
* Separate clients
* Separate calendars
* Your own customised notifications
* Your own operating hours and appointment types
* One month free trial
* A 50% discount until proper functionality is built
* AppointmentGuru monthly subscription deducted from two cards
* Two booking pages and a practice page

**One AppointmentGuru account**
* Shared practice information \*
* Shared login details using one email address and one mobile number
* Shared invoicing
* Shared clients
* Shared calendar
* Shared notifications that can specify practitioners
* Your own operating hours and appointment types
* One month free trial
* R400 per month
* Monthly subscription deducted from one card
* One booking page

\* Practice information is address, phone number, email address, practice description, logo and profile pic

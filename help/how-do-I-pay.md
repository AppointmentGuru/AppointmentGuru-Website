# How do I pay for my AppointmentGuru subscription?

Near the end of your free trial, AppointmentGuru will send you an email with details on upgrading to a paid monthly subscription via credit card.

If you choose not to subscribe, your AppointmentGuru account will become read-only (no functionality will be possible) but you will always be able to upgrade to a paid subscription at any time.

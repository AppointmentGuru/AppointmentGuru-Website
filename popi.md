# AppointmentGuru and POPI

POPI (Protection of Personal Information) is a data privacy and data protection law that was enacted in South Africa in 2013. The date it comes into effect isn't confirmed (sometime in 2018) but it's worth knowing how to start running your business to become compliant with POPI.

## How does it affect your business?

Generally, your business must make sure all personal information in your control was given with consent and is made secure. *Secure* means that you *must take appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational measures that will prevent loss, damage and unauthorised access of that information. Particularly if that unauthorised access is unlawful with the intent to use it in an unlawfully*.

POPI is a good thing! It gives businesses the opportunity to simplify, review and streamline business operations, policies and processes. Ones that will be based on sound business practices and implement correct and cost-effective technological solutions, like using AppointmentGuru!

## How does AppointmentGuru help you to be POPI-compliant?

1. We make sure that all data stored on the AppointmentGuru Platform is kept secure and conforms to the best IT practices. As the Regulator publishes more detail, we will implement changes on our own systems to reflect those of POPI legislation.

2. Your Client's details are kept confidential. By the time compliance is compulsory, we will have introduced features that will give your Clients more control over their own information, as required by POPI legislation.

3. Invoices generated from AppointmentGuru are sent to your Clients directly, to an email address they've provided to you. This eliminates the need to save versions on your computer, print copies to post and risk any unauthorised person(s) viewing the data.

4. If you're using AppointmentGuru's Virtual Receptionists, you can be assured that they have signed NDA's and/or patient confidentiality agreements (as compliance for POPI and the requirements of the HPCSA confidentiality). AppointmentGuru will recommend that practitioners inform and get consent from their clients, notifying them that the Virtual Receptionist will have access to their information.

## Where do I see more information on POPI?

Read the Act on [gov.za](https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/37067_26-11_Act4of2013ProtectionOfPersonalInfor_correct.pdf). For a short and sweet checklist, we found [The 8 Compliance Details](http://www.popi360solution.co.za/the-8-compliance-details/) useful.

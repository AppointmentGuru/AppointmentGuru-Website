## What are the benefits of offering online appointments?

* Expand your client-base beyond geographical limits.
* Clients save on travel time and limit hours missed at work or other responsibilities.
* Clients see you from the comfort of their own home or office (it can also reduce any associated anxiety).
* Therapy via video has been [researched](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22476305) and found to closely mimic an in-person appointment.
* Flexibility with your work location! Work from home, work from your office or even work on holiday.

## How does it work?

* We've integrated with [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) (online video conferencing software).
* You'll need to signup for the Zoom *Pro Plan* which costs $15 a month (the free plan doesn't allow for an integration).
* Confirm your Zoom account, get your Zoom API key and add it to your AppointmentGuru account settings.
* All set! Schedule online appointments with your clients (or your clients schedule them with you).
* *Note!* This is a beta AppointmentGuru feature - it means we're still working on perfecting the feature and it's only available to a limited number of customers.

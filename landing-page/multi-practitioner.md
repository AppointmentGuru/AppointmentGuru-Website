### How it works

* Each practitioner in your practice gets their own AppointmentGuru account
* Monthly pricing to be confirmed but expect a tiered structure **billed per practice** (eg. 2-5 practitioners: R600, 6-10 practitioners: R800).
* You'll get a practice website that you can give to your customers to make appointments with their choice o practitioner

## Customise your booking page

Your clients can book appointments with you via your booking page or use the AppointmentGuru app. Both options are free and the booking page can be customised to match your business and brand.

### Where to access the booking page settings

1. Go to the Settings page in the [web app](http://portal.appointmentguru.co/)
2. Scroll down to *My Website*
3. Click on *Choose a template* to view the background images you can add to your site (if there isn't one that you like, we would be happy to add one for you, just email it to <support@appointmentguru.co>)
4. If your site is not published, click on *Publish Now*
5. Click on the available link to view your site (the address will be something like http://bookme.guru/yourbusinessname)

### Other information included on your booking page

In addition to making bookings on the page, your Clients will also be able to see your location and contact details.

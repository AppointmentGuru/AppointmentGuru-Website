## Block out time so that clients can't book when you're busy doing other stuff

There will be blocks of time where you won't want your Clients to be able to book appointments. There are two ways to get this done: 

### Once-off blocking

1. Go to the [Schedule page](http://portal.appointmentguru.co/#/schedule) and mark a timeslot as unavailable by click on the `X`
2. On the [Calendar page](http://portal.appointmentguru.co/#/calendar) select the timeslot, click on *Custom Event* that appears in the block opening on the right

### Permanent blocking

1. On the [Settings page](http://portal.appointmentguru.co/#/settings), scroll past *Communication Messages*
2. Under *Operating Hours*, select the days and hours you'd like to be available for appointments
3. Remember to click on *Update Operating Hours*
4. Should you want to add different hours for different days, click on *Add More Hours* or *Add More Days*

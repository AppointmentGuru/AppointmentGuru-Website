## Exporting or syncing the calendar to your phone, Google or Outlook Calendars

### Finding the Calendar feed URL

The URL for your AppointmentGuru Calendar feed will be emailed to you soon after you've signed up. Or you can get it yourself in your AppointmentGuru account.

1. Login to the [AppointmentGuru web app](http://portal.appointmentguru.co/)
2. Click on calendar, then scroll to the bottom of the page. You should see a link which looks like this:

![Calendar subscribe link](images/exporting-and-syncing-the-calendar/calendar-subscribe-link.png)

Once you have the link, you can add it to your calendar of choice. Two things to remember:

1. it's a read-only calendar, so you won't be able to add appointments and expect it to sync back to AppointmentGuru
2. Some calendars take a while to sync (especially Google Calendar)

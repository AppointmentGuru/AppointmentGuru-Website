## Domain name

Buying a domain name (eg. *yourbusiness.co.za*) means that you can have your own website and personal email addresses. Domain names are annually renewed and you will be charged - the amount depends on the domain type (eg. co.za, .com etc) but you can expect to pay R100 and upward a year.

We will ask you for a bunch of details for the domain registration. The domain will be purchased on your behalf and you’ll get login details to manage that domain. [Send us an email](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) with your request.

*Price: Free to setup, annual domain registration fees apply.*

## Email

Once you have a domain name, we can setup your email address(es). We’ll make sure that you can check and send mail on various devices and email clients (eg Outlook). We recommend GSuite by Google (Gmail) - it costs US$5/user/month. [Send us an email](mailto:support@appointmentguru.co) with your request.

*Price: Free to setup, monthly fees may apply.*
